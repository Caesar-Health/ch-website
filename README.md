## 🔄 Migration Notice

This Vite-based marketing website has been **replaced by the Next.js version** for superior SEO and LLM optimization.

**New Repository:** [ch-website-nextjs](https://github.com/Caesar-Health/ch-website-nextjs)

**Migration Date:** November 1, 2025

## Why We Migrated

### Issues with Vite Version:
- ❌ Client-side rendering (search engines saw empty HTML)
- ❌ All pages shared same meta tags (poor SEO)
- ❌ Static sitemap required manual updates
- ❌ No structured data for AI/LLM crawlers
- ❌ Slower initial page load

### Benefits of Next.js Version:
- ✅ Server-side rendering (full HTML on first request)
- ✅ Unique meta tags per page (better search rankings)
- ✅ Dynamic sitemap and robots.txt
- ✅ JSON-LD structured data for AI understanding
- ✅ LLM bot permissions (GPTBot, Claude-Web, etc.)
- ✅ Faster page loads with static generation
